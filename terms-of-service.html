        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated: January 2025</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using the GutLog mobile application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>GutLog is a mobile application that allows users to track and log bowel movement information, including timestamps, Bristol types, volume, consistency, tags, and notes. The App provides features such as calendar views, data export, and reminders. All data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to external servers.</p>

        <h2>3. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
        <p><span class="important">IMPORTANT:</span> GutLog is not a medical tool and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The information you enter into the App is for personal tracking purposes only. The App is not intended to replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of information provided by this App.</p>
        <p>The Bristol Stool Scale information provided in the App is a general guide only and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical consultation. If you have concerns about your health, please consult a healthcare professional.</p>

        <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your device and any data stored within the App. You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the App only for lawful purposes</li>
            <li>Not attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>

            <li>Not share your device with unauthorized users if you wish to keep your data private</li>
            <li>Ensure that any data you export and share is done so at your own discretion</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data and Privacy</h2>
        <p>All data you enter into the App is stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store your data on external servers. You are solely responsible for backing up your data if desired.</p>
        <p>If you choose to export your data (e.g., via the "Generate Doctor Report" feature), you are responsible for how that exported data is shared and used. The App creates files locally on your device, and you have full control over whether and how you share those files.</p>

        <h2>6. Subscription and Payments</h2>
        <p>The App may offer optional subscription services or in-app purchases. All payments are processed through third-party payment processors (such as Apple App Store or Google Play Store). By making a purchase, you agree to the terms and conditions of the applicable payment processor. Subscriptions may auto-renew unless cancelled. You can manage your subscriptions through your device's app store settings.</p>

        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>

        <p>You retain ownership of any data you enter into the App. By using the App, you grant us a limited license to use aggregated, anonymized data for improving the App, provided such data cannot be used to identify you.</p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated through the App or via email if you have provided contact information. Your continued use of the App after such modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

        <h2>11. Termination</h2>
        <p>You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it from your device. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, with or without cause or notice, for any reason, including if you breach these Terms.</p>

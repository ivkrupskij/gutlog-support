## 2. Description of Service

GutLog is a mobile application that allows users to track and log bowel movement information, including timestamps, Bristol types, volume, consistency, tags, and notes. The App provides features such as calendar views, data export, and reminders. All data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to external servers.

## 3. Medical Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT:** GutLog is not a medical tool and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The information you enter into the App is for personal tracking purposes only. The App is not intended to replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of information provided by this App.

The Bristol Stool Scale information provided in the App is a general guide only and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical consultation. If you have concerns about your health, please consult a healthcare professional.

## 4. User Responsibilities

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your device and any data stored within the App. You agree to:

- Use the App only for lawful purposes

- Not use the App in any way that could damage, disable, or impair the App
- Not share your device with unauthorized users if you wish to keep your data private

## 5. Data and Privacy

All data you enter into the App is stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store your data on external servers. You are solely responsible for backing up your data if desired. 

If you choose to export your data (e.g., via the "Generate Doctor Report" feature), you are responsible for how that exported data is shared and used. The App creates files locally on your device, and you have full control over whether and how you share those files.

## 6. Subscription and Payments

The App may offer optional subscription services or in-app purchases. All payments are processed through third-party payment processors (such as Apple App Store or Google Play Store). By making a purchase, you agree to the terms and conditions of the applicable payment processor. Subscriptions may auto-renew unless cancelled. You can manage your subscriptions through your device's app store settings.

You retain ownership of any data you enter into the App. By using the App, you grant us a limited license to use aggregated, anonymized data for improving the App, provided such data cannot be used to identify you.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 10. Changes to Terms

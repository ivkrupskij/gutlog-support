    <h1>Privacy Policy for GutLog</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 11, 2024</p>
    <p>Igor Krupski ("we," "us," or "our") built the GutLog app as a commercial app.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection & Storage</h2>
    <p>GutLog is designed with your privacy as a top priority. <strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal health data.</strong> All information you enter into the app, including logs, notes, and tags, is stored exclusively and locally on your own device. We have no access to your entries.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>The app includes a feature to export your data as a CSV file. This action is initiated entirely by you. The exported file is saved to your device's local storage, and you have full control over how you choose to share it (e.g., via email with your doctor). We do not facilitate or monitor this sharing.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
